# Open Source Communities on Discord

This is the source list of OSS communities that use and live on Discord. It is used to populate the list at https://discordapp.com/open-source.
To add your project and community to the list:

* Fork the repo
* Add your logo into `/logos`
  -- Logos should be 40x40 SVGs
* Add your community to communities.json like so:


```json
{
  "logo": "your-logo.svg",
  "title": "Name of your project",
  "quote": "A short quote about how you use Discord for your project.",
  "inviteCode": "The public invite code to your project, usually the code after https://discord.gg/"
}
```

* Submit a PR with your change and, if all is OK, we'll merge it and pull it in!

Thanks for being part of Discord!
