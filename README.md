# Open Source Communities on Discord

This is the source list of OSS communities that use and live on Discord. It is used to populate the list at https://discordapp.com/open-source.
To add your project and community to the list:

* Fork the repo
* Add your logo into `/logos`
  -- Logos should be 40x40 SVGs
* Add your community to communities.json like so:

```json
{
  "logo": "your-logo.svg",
  "title": "Name of your project",
  "quote": "Optional: A short quote about how you use Discord for your project.",
  "quoteSourceUrl": "Optional: An optional source for the quote.",
  "inviteCode": "The public invite code to your project, usually the code after https://discord.gg/",
  "githubUrl": "The URL of your Github organization or project repository."
}
```

* Submit a PR with your change and, if all is OK, we'll merge it and pull it in!

Thanks for being part of Discord!

This list does not currently extend to Discord bots, but look forward to something for bots in the future.
